# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: extract data from objects

  Researched answer:In JavaScript, destructuring is when you decompose the properties of an object or the indexes of an array to separate them to create specific variables. This does not mean that these separated objects or arrays can never be used again in the program.



2. What are the three arguments that .map() can accept?

  Your answer: value index array 
<!--// im happy i remembered this!! -->

  Researched answer:The value of the element, the index of the element, and the array object being mapped. If a thisArg parameter is provided, it will be used as callback's this value. Otherwise, the value undefined will be used as its this value"



3. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: a class would be a blueprint can make objects

  Researched answer:Classes and objects from the essential part of Object-oriented programming, where a class can be considered as a construct that encapsulates a group of variables and methods; whereas, an object acts as member or instance of that class



4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?
 
  Your answer: a div generally contains a large block of data. span is meant for a mush smaller amount of data

  Researched answer:The difference between span and div is that a span element is in-line and usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line (such as inside a paragraph) whereas a div (division) element is block-line (which is basically equivalent to having a line-break before and after it) and used to group larger chunks of code

5. What is React.Fragment and why would you want to use it?
  
  Your answer:
  
  Researched answer: A common pattern in React is for a component to return multiple elements. Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM." While my researched study on this produced the above answer straight from React's website, I don't feel like this is really taking hold with me, but thats due to my unease with React. I'm currently taking an extra Udemy and a Codecademy course on React to suppliment my study.

6. What are three options for creating responsive design?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer: Responsive website design consists of the following three main components: Flexible layouts - Using a flexible grid to create the website layout that will dynamically resize to any width. Media queries - An extension to media types when targeting and including styles. Media queries allow designers to specify different styles for specific browser and device circumstances. Flexible media - Makes media (images, video and other formats) scalable, by changing the size of the media as the size of the viewport changes
